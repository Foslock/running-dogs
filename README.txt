1. The webpage "index.html" displays a tiled animated image and autoloops a sound in the background. There is a link to the source website in the bottom right of the browser window.

2. No collaboration, but these websites were helpful:
	a. http://www.htmlgoodies.com/primers/html/article.php/3920991/HTML5-Primer-How-To-Use-the-Audio-Tag.htm
	b. http://www.cssstickyfooter.com/using-sticky-footer-code.html
